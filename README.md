# Exploring the Data of Spotify and YouTube Music [2023]

Deployed at: https://spotify-youtube-analysis.streamlit.app/

## Overview
This project delves into the analysis of Spotify and YouTube Music datasets containing songs released from 1922 to 2020. By exploring these datasets, we aim to gain insights into the characteristics and trends of music over time. Key features such as duration, tempo, danceability, acousticness, and energy are examined to understand their influence on a song's popularity.

## Key Points
- **Dataset Analysis:** Analyzed Spotify and YouTube Music datasets to uncover trends and patterns in music attributes over the years.
- **Feature Selection:** Identified key features such as duration, tempo, danceability, acousticness, and energy influencing a song's popularity and reception.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Applied Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for predicting upcoming songs' average danceability, acousticness, and energy level based on historical data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas:** Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly:** Used for data visualization and plotting.
- **Scikit-learn:** Employed for machine learning tasks such as predictive modeling and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow and Keras:** Implemented LSTM neural network for predictive modeling.
- **Streamlit:** In order to showcase the data visualization and model
